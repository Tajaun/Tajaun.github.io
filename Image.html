SMART Board is an interactive whiteboard developed by SMART Technologies.  It is a large touch-sensitive whiteboard that uses a sensor for detecting user input (e.g. scrolling interaction) that are equivalent to normal PC input devices, such as mice or keyboards. A projector is used to display a computer's video output onto the whiteboard, which then acts as a huge touchscreen. The SMART Board usually comes with 4 digital writing utensils that use digital ink replacing the traditional whiteboard markers. 
The digital ink work by using an active digitizer that controls the PC input information for writing capabilities such as drawing or handwriting."
