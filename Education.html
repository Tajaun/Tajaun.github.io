<h1><u> <i>How Does Disruptive Technology Help In Education ?</u></i></h1>
<p>Disruptive technologies evolve in a completely different way. The first stage is the introduction of computer based
learning. The next stage would be the deployment of student centric technology.
In the first stage, i.e, computer based learning, the software will remain monolithic. The
instructional method will largely mirror the dominant type of intelligence or learning style in each
subject. However, the software may allow students to choose different ways of learning the
material. Computer based learning will disrupt teacher led instruction. In the second sage,
student centric technology, software can help students learn each subject in a manner that is
consistent with their intelligence and learning style. Today personal tutors are available only to
the rich. Student centric technology will provide "virtual" tutors to many more students who find
themselves left out today. Such virtual tutors will replace personal tutors and democratize
customized learning opportunities.</p>
<p>Connected devices offer the potential to relieve teachers of some 
of the administrative burden in taking roll or distributing materials, allowing more time to focus on 
students' learning needs.As students take their seatsin a connected classroom, attendance could be 
logged automatically by a wearable "smartboard" such as the RFID bands that many theme parks already 
use to check in to rooms, rides, and even find lost children.Eliminate routine tasks: Teachers shift
 time from classroom procedures to personal instructions. when it comes to keeping students on task, 
teachers could send a "haptic" vibration similar to silent notifications on mobile devices to a student's wearable 
or tablet, redirecting her attention or behavior in a way that limits public embarrassment and reduces direct 
confrontation. Disruptive Technology can also make lessons in schools more interactive and interesting.</p><br/>

<h2><i><u>The Evolution of Disruptive Technology in the past 10 Years.</u></i></h2>
<p> Technology has grown significantly in the past 10 years. The integration of Ebooks and smart boards among other equipment has enabled a better and easier of conveying lessons to the students. Statistics have shown that the lessons being taught through the means of disruptive technologies have been more receptive and more success is being shown as a result of this. In classrooms all over the country, Smart Boards are being installed because this amazing technology not only enhances the way teachers teach, but it also enhances the way students learn. It can provide students with an enriched learning experience by projecting visual elements. It also makes differentiated learning much easier because teachers are able to accommodate different learning styles. Visual learners are able to observe the whiteboard, while tactile learners can learn by touching the board. The touchscreen option allows teachers to run programs with the tap of their finger. This makes it not only makes it easy to navigate for the teacher, 
but for the students as well.In addition to that, a student's learning experience
 is enhanced by this technology because of its ability for students to 
 view diagrams, charts, videos and more, right on the huge screen in front of them.
 heir learning comes to life, and many students find it more fun to learn than ever before. Black boards or chalk boards could not allow this. 
 For example, advanced Smart Boards have the ability for students to use their 
 finger and write directly on them. Most Smart Boards have the separate workspaces so several children can utilize the s
 mart board at once. This interactivity provides students the ability to write, draw, or take notes via a tablet as well.</p>
<p> A teacher/tutor has the ability to monitor all her students' work and progression from either home or school with these new technologies.</p>
