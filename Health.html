<h2><u>Things That Can Be Said About Disruptive Technology in Health Care Are:</u></h2>
<ul>
<li> Innovation in health care is always recommended.
<li> New Is Good. 
<li> A good health system will make a better society. 
</ul>
<p>In the earlier times(1900s), the advancement in health care was hardly happening. It took a while for new medicines and treatments to come along. The use of herbs was the main cure for illnessess. In recent times 
this has come a far way through the means of disruptive technologies.In the past 10 years faster machines and better equipment have been developed and has made the health sector more responsive to illnessess.  
<h2><a name="Benefits"></a><u> Benefits</u><br/></h2>
 <p> We have moved from a framework of professional dominance to one measurement and accountability.<br/>
 No longer do physicians enjoy unquestioned authority to define what is medically necessary and how it<br/>
 must be delivered. In health care, disruptive technology will enable treatments that are less expensive<br/>
 and more consistently effective, allowing more people to consume more and higher quality health care;<br/>where physicians
 will play a smaller role in delivery. 
 <h2><u><a name="Method"> How To Bring This Type Of Technology To The Health Care Sector</u></h2>
 <ol>
 <li> Advance Medical Science.
 <li> Find ways to get around the existing medical model.
 <li> Develop science of service delivery.
 </ol>

		Retail clinics are a disruptive innovation because they operate outside conventional physician offices, disrupting existing business models of primary care. The technology driving their acceptance is the electronic medical record (EMR) with computerized physician order entry and sometimes e-prescribing applications embedded in the EMR.
		Prompts, alerts, and reminders using evidence-based decision support allow nurse practitioners, who staff 80 percent of the clinics, to make sound medical decisions and to extend their scope of practice. At least 96 percent of clinics use EMRs with varying levels of capabilities, according to the Convenient Care Association, the clinic trade group.

	<td> 
			Several coalescing technologies help move care from physician offices to less expensive venues under the umbrella term telemedicine. They include advances in network bandwidth, Internet access, software development, medical devices, advanced telephony, and video conferences. The business model is to deliver care conveniently to patients, often at home.
			Telemedicine improves access, promises better outcomes, and enables early screening and diagnosis to prevent more serious adverse and expensive health events.

	<td>
		Medical advances in other states and countries and speedy air travel are the technologies that enable medical tourism. The business model relies on wage and medical product price differentials along with a new breed of brokers who create comprehensive travel packages that make having surgery away from home at least 30 percent less expensive than in the United States.
