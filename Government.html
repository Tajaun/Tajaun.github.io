<h2><u><i><center> How Does Disruptive Technolgy help the Government ?</u></center></i></h2>
<p>The notion that the public sector can't or won't innovate is a
<strong><em>myth</em></strong>. Innovation in government occurs virtually every day from the
way governments across the world are opening up their data to entrepreneurs
to build apps for everything from real time transit information
to school test score comparisons to the myriad ways soldiers on the
battlefield innovate address life and death challenges. Disruptive technologies have largely modified the way that we now work. 
Not so long ago, it took an entire room to fit a computer. Then, with the emergence of the microprocessor, there came the birth of desktops 
and personal computers. With these new enhancements, the World Wide Web came into being allowing access to insurmountable information which greatly 
benefited the Government. The Government with the aid of disruptive technology has bee able to monitor economy and the country. 
Elections and other campaigns are better managed with the use of such technologies. Government
innovation is rarely if ever disruptive. Instead, it
typically represents what is called sustaining innovation.
Sustaining innovation can improve existing
products or services, typically adding performance
but at a higher cost and typically greater
complexity. Some sustaining innovations are incremental,
year-to-year improvements. Others are
dramatic, such as the new breakthrough business
models that emerged from the transition from
analog to digital telecommunications, and from
digital to optical.

<h2><u><i> Benefits of Having Disruptive Technolgy</u></i></h2>
<ul>
<li> It helps with productivity.</li>
<li> It produces higher productivity gains.</li>
<li> It makes the workforce happier.</li>
<li> Work can be done outside the office.</li>
<li>Enhance capabilities: Public safety officers respond faster and more proactively to emergencies</li>
<li>Engage partners: Localities build an ecosystem for water conservation and security</li>
</ul>
<p><strong> Disruptive Technology can increase value by both collecting better information about how effectively public servants, programs, and policies are 
addressing mission challenges, as well as helping government deliver services based on real-time and situation-specific conditions.</strong>
<a name="Example">
<h2><u> Examples of Disruptive Technology</u></h2>
<ul>
<li>Electronic Voting- Instead of casting your vote on a paper this can be done electronically.</li>
<li>Computer Assisted Survey Information Collection Machine- This Reduces the need for the manual method of getting information from citizens by the Government agents.</li>
<li>SmartPhones- Meetings and important information can be transmitted using this device.</li>
</ul>
